Oh man, just finished watching The Legend of Ochi, and I gotta say, what a ride! You ever watch something and just kinda sit there like huh, okay then? That's me right now. So many twists and turns, my brain's on a rollercoaster it didn't sign up for. It’s weirdly fascinating though, right? Like, whoever wrote this must’ve been, I don’t know, in some other galaxy when they dreamed it up. Sometimes I’m just like, “can movies get any weirder?” and then boom, something like this comes along to say a big fat yes.

I mean, the visuals were insane, like crazy good. The kind of stuff you see in a dream after eating way too much cheese, you know what I mean? Ochi... What even is Ochi? I feel like I still don’t know, but maybe that’s the magic of it. And that soundtrack? Who needs a storyline when you got those beats, seriously. But then again, I downloaded the movie just for the visuals, so maybe I'm just shallow like that.

> Plus, the characters are on some wild journey you'd think they just steered off into an alternate universe mid-movie and no one noticed. It’s like you gotta watch the movie twice just to catch half the stuff going on. You seen it? Tell me your brain is as fried as mine right now!

And you know the feeling when you’re halfway through and you’re still hoping for some aha moment that never comes? Yeah, had that. It’s like trying to solve a jigsaw puzzle with pieces from three different boxes. Buuuut, you kinda love it anyway? Maybe it’s just me being overtired and kinda wonky.

> Anyway, you'll have to tell me what you think. Cuz, you know, maybe I'm just missing the deep profoundness everyone and their cat got, or maybe it's just one of those you gotta watch late at night kinda things. Cheers to another movie to mull over with too much coffee tomorrow!
